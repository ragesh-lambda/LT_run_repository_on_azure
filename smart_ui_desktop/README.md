## Pre-requisites

1. In order to run your Smart UI tests with Selenium Python, you will need to set your LambdaTest username and access key in the environment variables. Click the **Access Key** button at the top-right of the Automation Dashboard to access it.

**Windows**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```

2. To create a `New Project` using the SmartUI Web Application, click the **New Project** button in the top-right corner of your dashboard.

3. Fill in the specifications such as **Platform**, **Project Name**, **Approvers**, and **Tags** as per your requirement and click **Create Project**.

4. Install `pip` and Python.

```
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo apt install python
```

5. The recommended way to run your tests would be in `virtualenv`. It will isolate the build from other setups you may have running and ensure that the tests run with the specified versions of the modules specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

```
pip install virtualenv
```

## Running Your First Selenium Python Test

1. To get started, clone the `Python-Selenium-Sample` Repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/smartui-python-sample
```

2. Next, create and activate the virtual environment in the `Python-Selenium-Sample` folder.

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Inside the `Python-Selenium-Sample` folder, export the `LambdaTest Credentials`. You can get these from your automation dashboard.

4. To run your first test, run the below given command.
```
python test.py
```

## Setting Up Github App Integration with SmartUI

### Steps 1: Integrate the your Lambdatest Account with GitHub App. 

You can integrate your LambdaTest account with the GiHub application in the following ways:

- Using OAuth

![github-app-landing-92ef6e152a7302cb9ab88f5034b9ec0c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126776938/232715867-f375b4df-1bc9-4e88-8340-44e986be2e9a.png)

### Step 2: Select your GitHub repository 

Go to your GitHub repository where you want to configure your SmartUI project. Check out our GitHub sample [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/smartui-node-sample).

### Step 3: Configure your test suite

Add the `Github` capability to your current test configuration:

```bash
const capabilities: {
  platform: "Windows 10",
  browserName: "chrome",
  version: "latest",
  "smartUI.project": "Smart UI sample test",
   github: {
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/statuses/commitId", // Mandatory
    "owner": "{OWNER}",  //Optional
    "repo": "{REPO}",  //Optional
    "commit": "{commitId}" //Optional
   }
}
```

### Step 4: Setting up your CI configuration

Setting up your CI workflow to execute on GitHub. Here is an example setup with `GitHub Actions`:

Go to `.github/workflows/<your_ci_file>.yml`.

```bash
    name: Execute SmartUI Test with Github App Integration
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Create commit status
      run: |
        API_HOST=https://api.github.com
        # Check out the PR branch
        git checkout $GITHUB_HEAD_REF
        # Get the commit ID of the last commit
        COMMIT_ID=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
        echo "Last commit ID of PR: $COMMIT_ID"
        GITHUB_URL=$API_HOST/repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/statuses/$COMMIT_ID
        echo "GITHUB_URL: $GITHUB_URL"
        echo "GITHUB_URL=$GITHUB_URL" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### Step5: Execute your test suite with CI

After the setup is completed, you can now execute your test suite with the Continuos Integration (CI) pipeline with any tool of your choice.

### Step 6: Commit you changes over git on a branch and raise the PR to main branch.

### Step 7: Now you will see the `lambdatest-smartui-app` in the PR.
